# NodeHive Preset & Beekeeper

## What is it?
Beekeeper is a way to manage "presets" which is a set of configurations for a NodeHive instance. A preset applies all defined configurations as "hard" configurations. Hard means, it's always overwriting, nevertheless a config was set via UI. It's a similar concept like Drupal recipes.

## Why?
This is useful, because we want to provide a basic set of configurations with NodeHive Core and there is no other way to do that when updating NodeHive.

## Drush commands

Install NodeHive core preset:
```
drush beekeeper:install
# Equivalent to the line above
drush beekeeper:install --preset=core
```

You can create your own presets and apply as follows:

```
drush beekeeper:install --preset=your_preset_name
```

```
# To apply NodeHive core preset, run
drush beekeeper:install --preset=nodehive

# To only apply NodeHive core permission preset, run
drush beekeeper:permission:install --preset=nodehive

# To only apply NodeHive core menu preset, run
drush beekeeper:menu:install --preset=nodehive

# To only apply NodeHive core drush commands preset, run
drush beekeeper:drush:install --preset=nodehive
```

## Create a custom preset

In your custom module, create the following folders and files:

```
> yourmodule
  > config
    > beekeper
      > your_preset_name (use any name you like)
        > default
          /{add any drupal config yml here}
        > beekeeper.drush.yml
        > beekeeper.menu.yml
        > beekeeper.permission.yml
```
