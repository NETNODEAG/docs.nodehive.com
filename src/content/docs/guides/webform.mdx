description: Guide How to send data to a NodeHive Webform
---

NodeHive comes with a visual editor which helps content editors work with content directly from the frontend. To enable the visual editor, the frontend code needs to communicate with NodeHive.

# Goal

Send data from a frontend form to a NodeHive Webform.

Examples of use cases:
- Newsletter subscription
- Contact form
- Feedback form
- Any other form which needs to be submitted to NodeHive
