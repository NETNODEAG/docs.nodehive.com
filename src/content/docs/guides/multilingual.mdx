## Full multilingual support

NodeHive has full support for complex multilingual setups. There is no fixed way, how you want to use multilingual capabilites. Depending on your use case, you need to configure it differently.

## Configuration

1. In your NodeHive instance, go to /admin/config/regional/language and choose the languages you need.

2. In the Content Modeller, per content type, select if the content type should be "translatable". 

3. When calling the api, set the language you want to load.
