### Who is behind NodeHive?

NodeHive is built and maintained by NETNODE AG (www.netnode.ch).

### What licence is NodeHive?

NodeHive is built on top of Drupal. Therefor it inherits the licence of Drupal https://www.drupal.org/about/licensing#drupal-license.

### What is the NodeHive Community Edition?

NodeHive CE is Open Source software. The code can be found on https://github.com/NETNODEAG/nodehive-headless-cms-ce as well as in drupalcode hosted repositories.

We apply an Open Core strategy which means all the NodeHive Core functionality is available as Open Source.

NETNODE AG maintains a SaaS and Enterprise edition which include additional features and integrations to third party tools. We do not publish these repos. If you are looking for support, contact us via www.nodehive.com/contact.

This allows us to build and maintain the open solution in a sustainable fashion.

### Why did you build a new `nodehive-js` client instead of extending `next-drupal`?

Our goal was to provide a straightforward tool that a frontend developer can easily use. For example, with our client, you can simply call `getNodes('article')` and render the data.
We built on the `jsonapiParams` library, and you can still use the NodeHive backend with `next-drupal` or directly call JSON:API if preferred. 
This approach also allows us to control the roadmap ourselves.

### Is there support for views and fetching from search API indexes in NodeHive?

We recommend directly calling JSON:API for fetching data to create lists. Of course, you can always expose data via a rest view which then can be consumed by your frontend code.

### I don't fully understand the concept of areas and fragments. Are they similar to layouts and blocks?

Areas and fragments are somewhat similar to layouts and blocks but are designed with headless CMS in mind. You can learn more about it in our [content modeling guide](https://docs.nodehive.com/guides/content-modelling/).

### Is only JSON:API supported with NodeHive, or are there plans to support GraphQL as well?

JSON:API is our default. GraphQL is on our roadmap, and we are open to contributions to help us integrate it.

### How compatible is NodeHive with other technologies like Vue, Nuxt, Next, Angular, Laravel, etc.?

NodeHive is fully compatible with various technologies. It essentially involves applying the space id as a filters to JSON:API, making it versatile across different tech stacks.
